[How to read a code](https://www.iamjonas.me/2020/08/how-to-read-code.html)

"Oh, that's Steves code. He quit two years ago. We don't touch it, it just works and no-one knows how. Just let it be." So I light up a cigarette which casts it's dim light on my rugged worn face. I'll say in a glass-gargling voice that'll put Batman to shame: "I'll figure it out".

It’s based on a two hour compiler lecture. We assume some familiarity with compiler concepts like intermediate representations (especially Static Single Assignment Form, or SSA for short), static analysis, and code generation. The intended audience is anyone wanting to understand JavaScriptCore better, or anyone thinking about using these techniques to speed up their own language implementation."

[Designing for Cognitive Differences](https://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-cognitive-differences/)

"Inclusive design is designing to be inclusive of as many users as possible, considering all aspects of diversity in users... ...accessibility and inclusiveness also mean considering more than just physical symptoms.
