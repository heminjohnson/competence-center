[How to read a code](https://www.iamjonas.me/2020/08/how-to-read-code.html)

"Oh, that's Steves code. He quit two years ago. We don't touch it, it just works and no-one knows how. Just let it be." So I light up a cigarette which casts it's dim light on my rugged worn face. I'll say in a glass-gargling voice that'll put Batman to shame: "I'll figure it out".

The intended audience is anyone wanting to understand JavaScriptCore better, or anyone thinking about using these techniques to speed up their own language implementation."

[Designing for Cognitive Differences](https://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-cognitive-differences/)
