[Coding with Punch cards](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/16112/what-did-code-on-punch-cards-do-with-the-other-six-bits-per-column)

"In the fifties and sixties, program source code was typically stored on punch cards, one card per line." They were basically sheets of paper. Normally programmer had a few hours a week to access a mainframe, and put a pile of the cards into the input slot. Kind of like as with ATM. If machine couldn't read the source code or there was an error in computation, programmer had yet another week to figure out an issue, prepare another pile of the punch cards and to make another try. The text dives in details on how the information was encoded in these cards.

[How to read a code](https://www.iamjonas.me/2020/08/how-to-read-code.html)

"Oh, that's Steves code. He quit two years ago. We don't touch it, it just works and no-one knows how. Just let it be." So I light up a cigarette which casts it's dim light on my rugged worn face. I'll say in a glass-gargling voice that'll put Batman to shame: "I'll figure it out".

It‚Äôs based on a two hour compiler lecture. We assume some familiarity with compiler concepts like intermediate representations (especially Static Single Assignment Form, or SSA for short), static analysis, and code generation. The intended audience is anyone wanting to understand JavaScriptCore better, or anyone thinking about using these techniques to speed up their own language implementation."

[Designing for Cognitive Differences](https://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-cognitive-differences/)
